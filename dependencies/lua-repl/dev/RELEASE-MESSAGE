Subject: [ANN] lua-repl $VERSION

Hi everyone,

I'm happy to announce a new version of lua-repl!

For those of you who aren't aware of it, lua-repl is a library to make
it easy to embed a REPL similar to the standalone interpreter in your
Lua application.  It also comes with a suite of plugins for enhancing
itself, as well as a "demo" console REPL that may be used as an
alternative to the standalone REPL (named rep.lua).

$CHANGE_SUMMARY

The source for lua-repl is located on Github:
https://github.com/hoelzro/lua-repl.  The release tarball is here:
https://github.com/hoelzro/lua-repl/archive/$VERSION.tar.gz

Thanks,
Rob
