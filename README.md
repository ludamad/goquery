Goquery (tentative repo title)
-
Undergraduate computer science project at UOIT, year 2013-2014.  
Goquery intends to be a tool or set of small tools, time permitting.

Currently in progress is a DSL for traversing Go languages.

GoAL: Go Analysis Language
=

The Go analysis language provides a high-level event based way to manipulate the Go AST. Specifically, it provides a domain-specific way of accessing the [go.ast package](http://golang.org/pkg/go/ast/).

Labelled nodes:
-
These Lua functions produce labelled nodes (we will call them **label-nodes**). The label consists of the name of the node, eg 'Fields', and the data consists of the arguments to the function, eg the list of fields as Lua strings. These labelled nodes assemble into a tree, but have no meaning until they bubble up into a *root level function*.


1) Expression nodes
-
Expression nodes evaluate to either complex objects, or strings. Strings are the main atomic type in GoAL, being a source-code oriented DSL. Complex objects usually but not always refers to members of the [go.ast package](http://golang.org/pkg/go/ast/).

+ **Object and string accesses** occur in two forms:  
    eg, **Receiver**.**type** "f"  
    or  **type**(**Receiver**("f"))  
    This second syntax makes object expressions easily composable (See **Compose** below).

+ **Eval** Evaluate to the first expression whose conditions are met.  
    *General form*: **Eval** (Conditions to meet **1**) (expression-node **1**) **...** (**Otherwise**) (expression-node **N**) 
+ **SQLQuery** Returns an SQL query as a loopable object. See **ForAll**.

2) Statement nodes
-
+ **Printf** C-like printf routine. Only '%s' is valid currently.
+ **Load** Load from a database. TODO: Document more
+ **Save** Save to a database. TODO: Document more
+ **SQLPrint** Prints the result of an SQL query.

3) Code conditional nodes
-
+ **IfExists** Evaluate if the expression does not evaluate to a **null** value.  
    *General form*: **IfExists** (object-expression-list)
+ **True**, **False**, **Otherwise** Constants. Note that **Otherwise** is an alias for **True**, for use in **Case** and **Eval** blocks.
+ **And, Or, Xor, NotAnd, NotOr, NotXor, Not**: Standard boolean operators. **Not** only takes one parameter.  
    *General form*: **{boolean op}** (conditional-node-list)

4) Code control labelled nodes
-
+ **Case** Perform the first code block whose conditions are met.  
    *General form*: **Case** (Conditions to meet **1**) (code-node-list **1**) **...** (**Otherwise**) (code-node-list **N**) 
+ **ForAll** Iterate a loopable object. All lists are loopable. Optional entry conditions can be specified before the code nodes.
    *General form*: **ForAll** (new variable, loopable expression) (Optional conditional-node-list) (code-node-list)



Root level functions
-
+ **Event** Used to define an AST analysis event. Optional entry conditions can be specified before the code nodes. These entry conditions can assert things about the variables defined.
    *General form*: **Event**(Variable definitions and event configuration, see below) (Optional conditional-node-list) (code-node-list)  
    *Example*: **Event**(**FuncDecl** *"f"*) (**Printf** *"Hello World!"*)

    Event takes a list of varied arguments:  
    
    + Expressions of the form eg (**FuncDecl** "f") define new objects. Any type name from the [go.ast package](http://golang.org/pkg/go/ast/) is valid.  
    + You can assign names to multiple nodes at once via eg (FuncDecl.Receiver "fd.r") would be the same as defining (FuncDecl "fd") and also setting its receiver to "r".
    + You can optionally specify a **CaseSet** by name. Only one **Event** with the **CaseSet** name will execute.
    + You can optionally specify a **EventSet** by name. **EventSet**s are used by **Analyze** to selectively execute **Event**s.
    + **ForAll** can be embedded, see above.

+ **Analyze**: Evaluate events for a list of files. Passing event sets to execute is optional; the global event set will be executed.  
    *General form*: **Analyze**(**Files** (list of files), (Optional) **EventSets**(list of event sets) )  
    *Example*: **Analyze**(**Files** "example.go")



New functions
-
Goal is extended primarily through Lua.  

Two convenience functions exist to form new functions, the **Compose** and **Inject** meta-functions.  
These two related functions can compose any of the nodes above (*whether or not doing so makes sense*!).

+ **Compose**(function **Func1**, function **Func2**)  
    Return a new function that applies **Func2** to every parameter, which are then passed in turn to **Func1**.  

    *Example*: **IfReceiverExists** = **Compose**(**IfExists**, **Receiver**)  
    *Example Usage*: **Case**(**IfRecevierExists** "r1") (**Printf** "We have a receiver!")  
    The new function takes any amount of objects, and evaluates if all of their receivers are not **null**.  

+ **Inject**(function **Func1**, function **Func2**)  
    Return a new function that applies **Func2** to the first parameter, and passes the rest of the parameters unchanged to **Func1**.

    *Example*: **IfReceiverExistsAnd** = **Inject**(**And**, **IfReceiverExists**)  
    *Example Usage*: **Case**(**IfRecevierExistsAnd**("r", **True**)) (**Printf** "We have a receiver and true is true!")

Note that it **Inject** == **Compose** for all one-argument **Func1**. The recommended idiom is to always use **Compose** in these cases.

Escaping to Lua
-
For cases where performance is acceptable, you may dynamically context switch between Lua and back. Basically, you can write arbitrary log in Lua.  
*(If you are on the fence about performance, be warned the context switch overhead is easy to underestimate.)*  

+ **LuaWrap** Returns a Lua function that, during the running of the event, is passed objects or string objects and returns an object or a string.  

    **Word of Warning:** The AST **can** be modified, since you have access to all Go reflection (thanks to '[luar](https://github.com/stevedonovan/luar/)') but do note it may render **currently running** DSL code incorrect (namely cache coherency) if it deals with the same data.


GoAL Implementation Details
=

The DSL is implemented using the luar package and builds a small set of bytecode operations:

	BC_STRING_PUSH = iota // Takes <object> <member string>, always pushes a single string.
	BC_STRING_CONSTANT // Pushes a string constant
	BC_OBJECT_PUSH // Takes <object> <member object>
	BC_LOOP_PUSH
	BC_LOOP_CONTINUE
	BC_POP_STRINGSN // Takes <number>, pops that many strings from the stack.
	BC_POP_OBJECTSN // Takes <number>, pops that many strings from the stack.
	BC_CONCATN
	BC_SAVE_TUPLE // Takes <tuple kind>, <tuple size>, pops tuple data from string stack
	BC_LOAD_TUPLE // Takes <tuple kind>, <key size>, pushes tuple to object stack
	BC_MAKE_TUPLE // Takes <key size>, pushes a tuple (string vector) onto the object stack
	BC_TUPLE_STRING_PUSH // Takes <object index>, pushes a string from the tuple onto the string stack
	BC_JMP_STR_ISEMPTY // Takes <code index>, jumps if the top string index is nil. Pops the top element
	BC_JMP_OBJ_ISNIL // Takes <code index>, jumps if the top object index is nil. Pops the top element
	BC_JMP // Takes <code index>, jumps unconditionally
	BC_PRINTFN // Takes <N>, first string is treated as format specifier, pops N

The DSL compiler is completely implemented in Lua using these very low level direct wrappings. The Go runtime has no concept of correct code. [The Lua compiler is in one (long) file here](https://github.com/ludamad/goquery/blob/master/src/goal/prelude.lua).
