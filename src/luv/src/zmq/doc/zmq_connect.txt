zmq_connect(3)
==============


NAME
----
zmq_connect - connect a socket


SYNOPSIS
--------
*int zmq_connect (void '*socket', const char '*endpoint');*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The _zmq_connect()_ function shall connect the socket referenced by the
'socket' argument to the endpoint specified by the 'endpoint' argument.

The 'endpoint' argument is a string consisting of two parts as follows:
'transport'`://`'address'. The 'transport' part specifies the underlying
transport protocol to use. The meaning of the 'address' part is specific to
the underlying transport protocol selected.

The following transports are defined:

'inproc':: local in-process (inter-thread) communication transport, see linkzmq:zmq_inproc[7]
'ipc':: local inter-process communication transport, see linkzmq:zmq_ipc[7]
'tcp':: unicast transport using TCP, see linkzmq:zmq_tcp[7]
'pgm', 'epgm':: reliable multicast transport using PGM, see linkzmq:zmq_pgm[7]

ZeroMQ sockets support one-to-many and many-to-one semantics. With the exception 
of 'ZMQ_PAIR' sockets every ZeroMQ socket type supports being bound with 
_zmq_bind()_ as a singular endpoint or connecting with _zmq_connect()_ as one 
of many endpoints. This allows combinations such as 1 ZMQ_REP to 100 ZMQ_REP and 
100 ZMQ_REQ to 1 ZMQ_REP socket connections. Refer to linkzmq:zmq_socket[3] for 
a description of the exact semantics involved when connecting or binding a socket 
to multiple endpoints.

NOTE: The connection will not be performed immediately but as needed by 0MQ.
Thus a successful invocation of _zmq_connect()_ does not indicate that a
physical connection was or can actually be established. Because of this, for most 
socket types the order in which a listening socket is bound and a connecting socket 
is connected does not matter. However, for inproc:// scheme sockets, the zmq_bind() 
must be executed before any sockets zmq_connect() to that endpoint. Refer to 
linkzmq:zmq_inproc[7] for more details.


RETURN VALUE
------------
The _zmq_connect()_ function shall return zero if successful. Otherwise it
shall return `-1` and set 'errno' to one of the values defined below.


ERRORS
------
*EINVAL*::
The endpoint supplied is invalid.
*EPROTONOSUPPORT*::
The requested 'transport' protocol is not supported.
*ENOCOMPATPROTO*::
The requested 'transport' protocol is not compatible with the socket type.
*ETERM*::
The 0MQ 'context' associated with the specified 'socket' was terminated.
*ENOTSOCK*::
The provided 'socket' was invalid.
*EMTHREAD*::
No I/O thread is available to accomplish the task.


EXAMPLE
-------
.Connecting a subscriber socket to an in-process and a TCP transport
----
/* Create a ZMQ_SUB socket */
void *socket = zmq_socket (context, ZMQ_SUB);
assert (socket);
/* Connect it to an in-process transport with the address 'my_publisher' */
int rc = zmq_connect (socket, "inproc://my_publisher");
assert (rc == 0);
/* Connect it to the host server001, port 5555 using a TCP transport */
rc = zmq_connect (socket, "tcp://server001:5555");
assert (rc == 0);
